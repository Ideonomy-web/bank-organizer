# Bank Organizer & Clean‑up

<p>
The <strong>Bank Organizer & Clean‑up</strong> plugin helps you keep your RuneScape bank tidy and efficient with minimal effort.
</p>

<h2>Features</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Pre‑set Categories:</strong> Quickly sort items into logical groups such as combat gear, skilling tools, consumables, and more.</li>
  <li><strong>Toggle & Customize:</strong> Enable or disable categories individually, set custom exclusions, and apply color‑coding for easy identification.</li>
  <li><strong>Category Pairing:</strong> Combine related categories (e.g., farming + potions + tools + food) Mix & match to suit your personal organization style.</li>
  <li><strong>Special Clean‑up:</strong> Highlights quest items and obsolete items that may be wasting valuable bank space.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Important Notes</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Certain niche items required for diary, clue steps, or useful quest items (e.g., <em>Bullroarer</em>, <em>Ice gloves</em>, <em>Cooking/Gold Gauntlets</em>) will <strong>not</strong> be marked for removal.</li>
  <li>Some items (e.g., <em>HAM robes</em>) are marked as discardable but may still be needed for specific clues — review before discarding.</li>
  <li>Some categories are toggled off by default - it is not recommended to turn every preset category on at once to avoid clutter and confusion.</li>
  <li>Each category comes pre-populated with certain exclusions in order to prevent too much overlap and random mis-fires on associated string names, this list is not exclusive and is guaranteed to miss certain case - add your own exclusions by simply inputting them in the "excluded items" box (lowercase) and comma-separated.</li>
</ul>
